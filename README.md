### Once I discovered my **passion** for web development I couldnâ€™t get enough. I enjoy every moment because there is always something new and great to learn. The best part about programming that I enjoy is **problem-solving** because there is always a way to find a solution. Working through the problem manually, simplifying and **optimizing** my steps. I learned different programming languages, along with different frameworks that have taught me how to create a front and back-end websites and applications. I look forward to working in a company that will give me the opportunity to apply my programming skills. I'm ready to **innovate**, share my knowledge, and continue to learn.
